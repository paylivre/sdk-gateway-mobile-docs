Importing your Merchant Logo Image is an extra addon config for the Paylivre's SDK Gateway. <br/>
If no image is provided, Paylivre's SDK Gateway will, by default, present Paylivre's logo.

## Implementation

Inside the function `startCheckoutByUrl` (or `startCheckoutByParams`) that instantiates the chosen checkout class <Link to="/android/start-checkout-by-url">StartCheckoutByUrl</Link>
(or <Link to="/android/start-checkout-by-params">StartCheckoutByParams</Link>)
use the `setLogoResId()` method prior to the `startPayment()` passing the desired image. That's it.

### kotlin

```kotlin title=./java/MainActivity.kt lineNumbers=true highlight={5-6}
fun startCheckoutByUrl() { // or startCheckoutByParams
    val checkout = // ... instantiate it as presented before

    // set merchant's logo
    val MERCHANT_LOGO_RES_ID: Int = R.drawable.logo_merchant // loading from a given file
    checkout.setLogoResId(MERCHANT_LOGO_RES_ID)

    // method that initializes the SDK
    checkout.startPayment(this)
}

```

### java

```java title=./java/MainActivity.java lineNumbers=true highlight={5}
void startCheckoutByUrl(Integer requestCode, String url) {
    StartCheckoutByURL checkout = // ... instantiate it as presented before

    // set merchant's logo
    checkout.setLogoResId(R.drawable.logo_jackpot_new); // loading from a given file

    // method that initializes the SDK
    checkout.startPayment(this);
}
```

## Logo recommended file type

If using Android Studio IDE, you can import either image or vector assets.<br/>

The ideal file type is vector, i.e.: `svg` (Scalable Vector Graphics). But you can also use `png`, as long as you follow the recommended size, as presented below.

## Logo recommended size

For a better display of your logo, it needs to be rectangular and larger in its horizontal axis (width).
Your image will be resized accordingly to a <b>126dp:26dp\*</b> ratio (horizontal:vertical), e.g.:

126dp:26dp<br/>
252dp:52dp<br/>
504dp:104dp<br/>
1008dp:208dp<br/>
...<br/>

"To preserve the visible size of your UI on screens with different densities, you must design your UI using density-independent pixels (dp) as your unit of measurement."

### Examples

As visual examples, we present the following incorrect image sizing:

- For a `26dp:26dp` ratio (square):

  <GenericLogoSize type="incorrect_logo_26_26" />
  <br />

- For a `52dp:26dp` ratio (rectangular, but smaller in the width):

  <GenericLogoSize type="incorrect_logo_52_26" />
  <br />

- For a `75dp:26dp` ratio (rectangular, but smaller in the width):

  <GenericLogoSize type="incorrect_logo_75_26" />
  <br />

- For a `170dp:26dp` ratio (rectangular, but larger in the width):

  <GenericLogoSize type="incorrect_logo_170_26" />
  <br />

Finally, the expected result, when the imported image follows a `126dp:26dp` ratio, is present below. Where we can see a more optimized used of the available width:height, and no distortions.

<GenericLogoSize type="correct_logo" />
