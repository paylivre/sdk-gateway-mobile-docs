Laguage is an extra addon config for the Paylivre's SDK Gateway. <br/>
If no language is provided, Paylivre's SDK Gateway will pick the language from the user system (if it is supported).
If not supported, the default language will always be english (en-EN).

## Supported Languages

| Language            | Default | Code string |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| English             | Yes     | "en-EN"     |
| Portuguese (Brazil) | No      | "pt-BR"     |
| Spanish             | No      | "es-ES"     |

## Implementation

Inside the ... use the `setLanguage()` method passing the correct code string.

```kotlin title=./java/MainActivity.kt lineNumbers=true highlight={3}
fun startCheckoutByUrl() { // or startCheckoutByParams
    val checkout = // ... instatiate it as presented before
    checkout.setLanguage("en-EN")
    checkout.startPayment(this)
}

```
